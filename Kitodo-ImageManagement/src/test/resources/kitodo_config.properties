# If ImageMagick is not on the PATH, or the convert command is hidden by
# another convert in C:\Windows\System32\, which is earlier on the PATH,
# you can manually set the ImageMagick search path here. (This is mainly a
# problem in Windows environments.)

#ImageManagement.searchPath=C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick-7.0.7-Q16

# If the ImageManagement needs to temporarily write files, you can set the
# directory to use here:

#ImageManagement.tmpDir=/tmp/

# The ImageManagement.param.* section can be used to pass arbitrary parameters
# to ImageMagick. You can set limits here. For a description, see:
# https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php?#limit

#ImageManagement.param.limit.map=40MB
#ImageManagement.param.limit.memory=40MB

# Timeout for a singular ImageMagick operation in seconds. Defaults to 2 hours.

#ImageManagement.timeoutSec=7200

# ImageMagick can be executed remotely using SSH. You can list several hosts
# here, separated by comma. Key-based authentication must be properly set up.
# File system paths must be (mounted) equally on the remote machine(s).

#ImageManagement.sshHosts=user@rhost1.kitodo.org,user@rhost2.kitodo.org
