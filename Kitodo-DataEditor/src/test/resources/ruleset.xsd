                Acquisition levels are used to define which metadata must be recorded in which levels. There are
                currently two hard-coded levels called "create" and "edit", "create" is when creating a new process in
                the system, "edit" is when editing the metadata in the metadata editor. (The development goal here is
                that any data entry level names can be used in the ruleset, which can then be assigned to individual
                workflow steps in the workflow editor. This is not yet possible as of October 2020.) For each
                acquisition stage, the &lt;settings/&gt; ("alwaysShowing", "editable", "excluded", "multiline") can be
                determined individually. The &lt;settings/&gt; in the current acquisition stage go before the general
                &lt;settings/&gt; of the ruleset. This makes it possible, for example, to edit a metadata entry when
                creating the process, but only to be able to display it later or even to hide it without losing it.

                The codomain defines which technical value range a metadata entry can accept. If no codomain is

                URI; if the type is specified, this applies. If a namespace has been specified, Production looks for an
                XML file in the same directory whose file name is the same as the last segment of the namespace URI
                and, if it finds it, makes the namespace elements available as a selection list.

                The attribute "minDigits" can be used with type="integer" to define a minimum number of digits, which
                will save the value with leading zeroes, if it has less digits.

            <xs:documentation xml:lang="en">
                Divisions (&lt;mets:div&gt;) serve to subdivide the logical or physical structure of the medium being
                described. A division is considered a possible root of the logical description if it has an attribute
                "processTitle". The value of the attribute consists of fixed text in single quotation marks (') and
                metadata keys, the values of which are to be inserted, separated by pluses (+). It can also be empty
                if the process title should be entered manually. In this case, the attribute "withWorkflow" has an
                effect if it is "false". (A work usually has a workflow, but this can be switched off for a
                higher-level unit, for example a series.) The "use" attribute can be used to define a technical use of
                the value. Several uses are to be recorded in ONE attribute with several values separated ​​by spaces.

                If a division is defined within &lt;subdivisionByDate&gt;, the attribute "dates" indicates in which
                metadata key is stored, when this division dates, and the attribute "scheme" indicates the pattern
                (date format). 'yyyy' stands for a year, 'yyyy/yyyy' for a period of two consecutive years, 'MM' for
                the month and 'dd' for the day. The number of letters defines a minimum length of the number (leading
                zeros).

                The root of the physical structure must be called "physSequence". There are three structures for
                physical objects, a "page" for the page of a bound or stitched publication, "track" for an aural or
                audiovisual recording, and "other" for another linked physical entity. In between there can be
                intermediate levels that describe the physical structure, for example boxes and folders. This can be
                freely designed.

                The attribute specifies in which section of the METS file the metadata key is stored. The areas have a
                rough semantic meaning:

                'description' is the standard value, the metadata entry is written to the &lt;dmdSec&gt;. It describes
                    the digital resource, sometimes referred to as workpiece properties.

                'digitalProvenance' is rarely needed. Information on the further development of the digital resource is
                    stored in this area if this happens after the original creation process of the digital resource,
                    for example if video was converted into another format. (This is mostly outside the scope of
                    Production).

                'rights' describes the legal situation, i.e. how far the digital resource may be made publicly
                    accessible.

                'source' stores information on the digitized template of the digital work is stored. The area is
                    sometimes referred to as the template properties.

                'technical' is to store internal data that must be saved during processing, for example scanner and OCR
                    settings. The area is sometimes referred to simply as properties.

                'mets:div' writes the value in an attribute of the &lt;mets:div&gt; XML element. Only the "id"s
                    'LABEL', 'ORDERLABEL' (type: character string) and 'CONTENTIDS' (type: any URI) are permitted here.

                A possible metadata key is defined with the &lt;key&gt; element. A key must have an "id" that is
                unique. For the key, attribute "domain" can be used to determine in which domain (area of ​​the METS
                file) it is saved, and attribute "use" whether it has a specific technical use. Multiple usages must be
                coded in the same attribute "use" as being separated by spaces.

                Each key must have at least one &lt;label&gt;. Several &lt;label&gt;s can be specified in different
                languages. Element &lt;codomain&gt; can be used to define a technical set of values ​​(e.g. 'integer',
                'anyURI' or a valid calendar 'date'). The application then offers appropriate input controls. If a
                selection is to be made from a value list, the individual values ​​must be recorded as &lt;option&gt;
                elements. The element &lt;pattern&gt; can be used to specify a regular expression that entered values
                must meet. The element &lt;preset&gt; can be used to specify a value (in the case of the multiple
                selection type, several) that should be automatically entered when adding the metadata entry.

                Alternatively, keys can be nested. In this case the above elements except &lt;label&gt; are omitted,
                instead the lt;key&gt; contains several &lt;key&gt; elements. If &lt;key&gt;s are nested, the "id" of a
                subkey within the key must be unique, but multiple keys can have subkeys with the same "id" as it
                appears in another key.

                A &lt;setting&gt; describes how the input field for a specific metadata "key" should be displayed. With
                "alwaysShowing", it can be requested that an empty input field is automatically offered. Usually, you
                have to manually add a field that does not yet exist. With "editable" a field can be set as read-only.
                This can be used if a certain metadata entry must not be changed at a certain point in time. (If no
                changes are to be made to the metadata in its whole, this should be mapped via the authorization
                management, not via the ruleset.) With "excluded", a metadata entry can be hidden. It is not deleted,
                it is simply not displayed. With "multiline", a larger input box can be requested for a metadata key.
                This makes sense for entries that contain a lot of text, for example an abstract. Settings must be
                nested in order to define properties of subkeys.

                For regular publications, the issues of which are identified by a calendar date, for example

                of processes with the calendar selection. The attribute "yearBegin" specifies the calendar day on which

                Production supports the following data types as a range of values for metadata keys:

                'anyURI' allows any valid URI to be entered (e.g. URL, URN, ...). It is also selected automatically
                    if a "namespace" is specified.

                'boolean' is a truth value, either present or absent, with a fixed value. Exactly one &lt;option&gt;
                    element with the "value" that is written in the case of selection must be specified for 'boolean'.
                    A switch for input will appear.

                'date' allows any valid calendar dates to be entered. A calendar is displayed for input support.

                'integer' requires an integer. In combination with the &lt;pattern&gt; element, this can be limited
                    to positive values. A spinner is displayed as the input element.

                'string' is the default, meaning any values can be entered.
